    <section id="section1" class="content" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="0">
      Whenever someone gambles, the house always has the advantage over the players, this is because casinos have a mathematical advantage called the "house edge." No matter what game the player chooses to play, the house always has an advantage over the players. For example, a roulette wheel is numbered from one to 36, so you might think this puts the odds for winning a single number bet at 36 to one. However, roulette wheels also have a zero, and sometimes they have a double zero and even a triple zero. The actual odds of winning are thus 37 to one, 38 to one, or 39 to one, not 36 to one. The house edge when playing American roulette, which uses a roulette wheel with both a zero and a double zero is 5.26 percent. So for every $1 million bet at the roulette tables in a casino, management's profit is slightly more than $50,000, and the remaining $950,000 or so is returned to the bettors. The casino’s goal isn’t to bankrupt the players in one sitting, but to give them some hope to gradually empty their pockets in the long run. Slot machines and other games are also programmed so that the casino profits overall, even if some players win big occasionally.

    <button class="collapsible" aria-expanded="false" aria-controls="section3" id="toggle3">Why Gambling is So Addictive</button>
    <section id="section3" class="content" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="0">
      To prevent gambling addiction, we must first look at the causes of the problem. One of the main causes of this is the way gambling websites and casinos are intentionally designed to be addictive. Gambling websites use tricks such as near wins, flashy visuals to make you spend more money and time gambling. Additionally, the fact that these websites can be accessed anywhere at any time makes them more dangerous and addictive. Casinos, on the other hand, use tricks like removing any clocks and windows, offering you free drinks, and creating an exciting atmosphere to make people lose track of time and their money.<br><br>
      Another issue is the lack of awareness among young people, because they often don’t realize that these platforms are using psychological manipulation to keep them engaged. Without proper education on how gambling works or its long term consequences, young people may view it as an easy way to make money or just a thrilling game. This lack of understanding increases their risk of developing addictive behaviors early on.

    <section id="section4" class="content" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="0">
      Gambling can lead to serious harm to both physical and mental health. These problems include financial stress, mental illness and even self harm, or worse suicide. Gambling is also tearing families and relationships apart, for every one addicted gambler there’s at least 6 people who suffer with him. These people could have never gambled in their life but are still affected by the consequences that the addict creates. In some families it becomes so bad that the addiction gets transferred down to the addicted person's family or friends which means that the gambling legacy lives on as well as the other family members or friends start affecting their families and friends.
